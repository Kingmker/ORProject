# ORProject Group: KND

Below is my code that I stole from all over the internet to make, I would like to thank Dr. Validi for most of it (60% or more), forums for about 25% and finally tutorial videos and webpages for the remaining 15% of it.I would like to mention that Mr. Vu Long Tran also helped with it, just to bounce ideas off of mostly.
I would also like yall to know that this code does have the capacity to check for 3 way cycles, and for that I would like to thank Mr. Isaac Covorubias (sorry I misspelled your name Isaac) he wrote the custom KND2.json file that purposefully has a simple 3 way cycle and then tested it with both his custom 3 way cycle code and with Dr. Validis code and they both confirmed it so I can confirm that there is indeed no 3 way cycles in any of the data I tested my code on.
Thank you and have a Merry Christmas!
